How to use this
---------------

2. The teams for each region are in separate tabs including the play-in games.  All the labels are in the last tab. Once you have entered all the teams and information, "Publish to the web..."
3. In the Publish window, you'll find a URL that will contain a key. Copy that and paste into line 16 of js/bracket.js
